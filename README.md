###2019-2020/autumn semester

## Hi,
As of writing this, I am a sophomore `Computer Engineering` student at [Széchenyi István University](https://uni.sze.hu/kezdolap) (Győr, Hungary). I took a course called `Microelectromechanical systems` and as a homework, by the end of the semester, we had to create a project by ourselfs and present it to the teacher as an 'exam'.</br>
I know some computer vision, I tried OpenCV before and I am not totally clueless with microcontrollers so my idea was to make a small RC like car with a Raspberry Pi on top that can follow a colored line on the floor, driving fully autonomously. For this I used a brand new Pi 4B and it's official camera.</br>

Below you can find links to the developer and the user manuals. The user manual was made for inexperienced users, who just want to use the car and not modify anything on it. The developer manual is much more comprehensive description of how the car works and it's also a step-by-step guide to build one if you want to make your owm.</br>
